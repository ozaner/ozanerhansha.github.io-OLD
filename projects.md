## Breast Cancer Classification
An artificial neural network trained on the [Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(original)). It can classify breast cancer cells as benign or malignant based on 10 pieces of data regarding its size, shape and other variables. The network has around a 90% accuracy on random samples.

## qRNG - A Quantum Random Number Generator
qRNG is a cloud based python package that uses IBM's QISKit API to connect with any one of their 3 publicly available quantum computers to generate random numbers. The advantage of this is that the data generated by these computers are truly random as they source their randomness from the collapse of quantum wavefunctions themselves!

That said, generating random numbers using this method is entirely unpractical. The project is more so to demonstrate the prospect of using cloud based quantum computing for cryptographically secure RNGs.

<!-- ## Quantum Computing
When IBM made their 5 qubit quantum computer available to the public (or more specifically those who signed up for research purposes) I was one of the first to sign up, despite the fact I had no formal knowledge of quantum computation or quantum algorithms.

It wasn't until 2017 that IBM released a python API, [QISkit](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-sdk-py), to interact with their quantum computer rather than the web-based GUI that was available before. There wasn't much bombast regarding it's release but, critically, it allowed for the creation of quantum circuits programmatically and thus the implementation of general purpose quantum algorithms.

And so, using QISkit, I implemented Shor's algorithm in it's entirety (classical and quantum parts). You can find the code [here](https://github.com/ozanerhansha/QuantumComputing/blob/master/shorsalgo.py).

## FileToPNG
A program written in Java that converts any file into an encoded PNG file that can then be sent to a recipient (via a text message for example), received, and decoded back into the original file.

An interesting consequence of how the image is directly encoded from the bits of the file is that similar types of files share similar structures. Here's an example:

## Reinforcement Learning Pong AI
This is an artificial neural network trained to play pong against a competent bot. Learning starts to appear after 500 games (a game goes on until one player reaches 20 points) and it reaches a 50% win-rate at 8000 games. The network seems to asymptote at a 90% win-rate but more testing needs to be done.

## Neurosky EEG Test App
This is an Android application that can communicate with a Neurosky EEG headset. It allows the user to save a CSV of their brainwaves at different key frequencies:

- Delta Waves (0.1 - 3 Hz)
- Theta Waves (4 - 7 Hz)
- Alpha Waves (8 - 12.5 Hz)
- Beta Waves (12.5 - 30 Hz)
- Gamma Waves (32 - 100 Hz)

## Handwritten Digit Classifier
#### Neural Network
A model for classifying handwritten digits (0-9) using a convolutional neural network trained for image recognition. It was trained on the [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) for over 20,000 iterations of 50 images each (1,000,000 total examples). The network was programmed in python with Google's [*TensorFlow*](https://www.tensorflow.org/) library.

Click [here](https://github.com/ozanerhansha/NeuralNetworks/blob/master/src/MNIST/conv/mnist_convolutional.py) to see the code.


#### Android App
The model was then exported and, via TensorFlow's Inference API in Java, implemented into an Android App. It includes a canvas for drawing the digits and percentages of confidence in its guess.
