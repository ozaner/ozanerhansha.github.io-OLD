#### Proper Time
In truth this formula only applies to two spacelike separated events, as opposed to two timelike separated events. The difference between them is essentially whether the two events could be causally connected (they are close enough to be affected by a particle traveling at the speed of light). See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone) for more.

So then, what's the formula for two timelike separated events? Well, just like we converted time to length by multiplying it by the speed of light, we can do reverse that process to convert length to time. By dividing the all the coordinates by $$c$$ and ($$i$$): $$(x,y,z,ict)\rightarrow (\frac{x/ic},\frac{x/ic},\frac{x/ic},t)$$

$$\Delta s = \sqrt{\Delta t^2-\frac{\Delta x^2}{c^2}-\frac{\Delta y^2}{c^2}-\frac{\Delta z^2}{c^2}}$$
