# Congress
The United States Congress was established in 1789 by the US Constitution and is the federal legislature of the US.
It is bicameral, the lower house being the House of Representatives and the upper house being the Senate.

Congress serves as the legislative branch of the United States and comprises of members that are all directly elected by the citizens of the state they represent. There are 435 Representatives and 50 Senators.

## Elections
Every two years a new congress comes into session (as of this post we're up to 115). This new congress comprises of a newly elected House of Representatives (usually the same incumbents), 1/3 of a newly elected Senate (again, usually the same people), and the other 2/3 of the previous senate.

#### House
All representatives are up for reelection every **2 years**. The framers set it up this way so that representatives are more beholden to their **constituents** (the people who elected them and who they represent).

#### Senate
Senators have a **6 year term** but, unlike representatives, elections are not held for all the senators at once. Instead 1/3 of the senate is up for reelection every 2 years.

The Senate's 6 year term was set up to contrast the House's 2 year term. Being in office for 6 years means, in theory, the senator is not as beholden to their constituency and can make decisions that they feel are right for the people, but which the people might not necessarily want.
