## Poorly Defined Concepts
What is jealousy? How about a cat? What does it mean to be free? What are you?

These are pretty simple questions. Jealousy is an emotion we feel when we envy someone for what the have, a cat is an animal with a tail and four paws, freedom is the state of being able to do what you please, and I am a human being with thoughts and emotions.

But what is *jealousy* really? What am I *really*? What *really* is a cat?

There is no formal definition of these concepts. We just know them when we see them. I know what jealousy feels like. I know what being me feels like. I know a cat when I see it.

Unlike a well defined concept, say a Cesium atom, I can't point to some mathematical construction that represents the idea of jealousy.

#### What's Wrong with being Poorly Defined?
Why is this a problem? Well, without a formal definition the statements we can make about a concept are limited and just as hazy as the definition. A chemist can give you certainty that a particular solution will erode a metal but a psychologist may only have a hazy idea of why you may feel a certain emotion (whatever an emotion is) and what could cause it.

#### Computation
Computers are a prime example of this, as they can only deal with problems that are well defined. Ask it to solve the quadratic function, model an atom, or even play music and it'll do just fine. But ask it to identify a cat in a picture and it might run into trouble. Digital music is just a sound wave sampled at a high rate, easy. But what is a cat (or at least an image of one) mathematically speaking?

*The way I deal with this problem in this post isn't practical and the can't be used in computing, but the field of machine learning tackles the "what is a cat?" problem via machine learning. And the underlying philosophy behind that machine learning is something called the manifold hypothesis. It isn't as general as what I describe here but its far more practical*

## Well Defined Concepts
To formally deal with any idea or concept, it has to be well defined. By making our definitions more concrete we can make more precise statements about these ideas. This is how science is born.

Take the Cesium atom again. We know an atom is a collection of protons, neutrons and electrons which are further composed of elementary particles, all of which governed by an exact set of equations (quantum mechanics).

A Cesium atom is thus completely mathematically defined. Everything about it is encapsulated in the equations, no need to look at the natural world to understand it.

This applies to all atoms, and thus all molecules, and further anything in the universe made of matter, like humans. This shouldn't come as a surprise. After we know that math is the bedrock of science and thus of formal knowledge.

Take psychology. It is really just applied biology, which is just applied chemistry, which is just applied physics, which is just applied mathematics.

This *chain of abstraction* applies to all fields of human knowledge, but its relation to psychology and the human mind will be particularly useful to us...


## Bridging the Gap
This relation between the most fundamental (and very well defined) concepts in our universe, elementary particles, to the most hazy and abstract ones, like emotions, is what will allow us the bridge the between poorly defined and well defined.
