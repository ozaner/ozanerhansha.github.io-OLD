### Background
In this post I will attempt to detail the algebraic properties of the 5 most common logic gates.
* [`NOT`](#not-gate)
* [`AND`](#and-gate)
* [`OR`](#or-gate)
* [`NAND`](#nand-gate)
* [`XOR`](#xor-gate)

*As it turns out, all of these examples can be considered groups*

### NOT Gate

### AND Gate

### OR Gate

### NAND Gate

### XOR Gate
