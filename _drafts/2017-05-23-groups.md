### Background
Groups are considered the simplest, yet still complete, algebraic structure and is the focus of [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory).
For an introduction on the history of abstract algebra and algebraic structures refer to my post on it [here](/2017/05/21/abstract-algebra).

### Definition
A group is a set

### Extending the Group
But what if we want equations with both multiplication and addition? Well we could just 'switch' the group we are using whenever we switch from addition to multiplication or vice versa. But this is sloppy. To create an algebraic structure that includes two operations, like addition and multiplication, we need to talk about rings. Luckily I wrote a post on it [here](/2017/05/24/rings).
