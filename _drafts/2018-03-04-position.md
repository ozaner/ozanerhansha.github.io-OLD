The position/displacement of a particle or object in **space** is defined as a point on an n-dimensional **Cartesian coordinate system**. This point can equivalently be thought of as a vector. Note that displacement is the net, not total, distance traveled by an object in a particular direction.

#### Displacement Function
The displacement function, $$\vec{s}(t)$$ of a object takes a time and outputs its displacement at that time.

Taking the derivative of an object's displacement function with respect to $$t$$ provides the object's [velocity]() function, $$\vec{v}(t)$$:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{d} t}\vec{s}(t)=\vec{v}(t)$$

### Classical Physics
In classical physics, a position is a 3-dimensional vector with components $$\left(x,y,z\right)$$.

So in this case, the position function maps from time to real 3-space:

$$s:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$$

The magnitude of displacement, or net **distance**, is calculated the same as any vector:

$$\left|\vec{s}\right|=d=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$$

### Relativity
In relativity, position is only invariant in a particular non-inertial reference frame. This necessitates a notion of position that is invariant with respect to space-time. This 4-dimensional position (3 spatial dimensions and 1 time) is called 4-position, or more commonly as an **event**.

An event is defined as a 4-dimensional vector with components $$\left(t,x,y,z\right)$$
