## Poorly Defined Concepts
What is jealousy? How about justice? What does it mean to be free? What *are* you?

These aren't foreign questions to us. Jealousy is an emotion we feel when we envy someone for what they have, a cat is an animal with a tail and four paws, freedom is the state of being able to do what you please, and I am a human being with thoughts and emotions.

But what is *jealousy* really? What *really* is justice? What does it meant o be *human*?

There is no formal definition of these concepts. We just know them when we see them. I know what jealousy feels like, I know what being human feels like (I hope), and I know injustice when I see it.

But what about a cat? Surely a cat has a particular genome that defines it regardless of its outward appearance, right? But in a world where cats evolved from another species via mutations to individual base pairs on their DNA (not big leaps), where do we draw the line between cat and cave-cat, so to speak. Moreover is a picture of a cat a cat? It certainly represents a cat, but there is no formal way to tell whetehr a given picture is of a cat or not. No formula, no physical law of cats. We can tell a cat, real or fake, from another animal using our *intuition*, whatever that is.

Unlike a well defined concept, you can't point to some mathematical construction that represents these ideas. I can't tell you without a doubt whether a given action was 'moral' or not, nor can I even define morality.

#### What's Wrong with being Poorly Defined?
Why is this a problem? Well, without a concrete definition, the statements we can make about a concept are limited and just as hazy as the definition. A chemist can give you certainty that a particular solution will erode a metal but a psychologist may only have a hazy idea of why you may feel a certain emotion (whatever an emotion is) and what could have caused it.

*That said, it's not too far-fetched to imagine an operational definition of emotions based on the amount of certain neurotransmitters in one's brain. But of course, this is a bit of an oversimplification*

#### Computation
Computers are a prime example of this, as they can only deal with problems that are well defined. Ask it to solve the quadratic function, model an atom, or even play music and it'll do just fine. But ask it to judge how strong an argumentative essay is and it might run into trouble. Digital music is just a sound wave sampled at a high rate, easy. But what is a good essay formally speaking?

*The way I deal with the problem of poorly defined concepts in this post isn't really practical to computing. Instead this "what is a cat?" problem is tackled via **machine learning**. And the underlying philosophy behind that machine learning is something called the [manifold hypothesis](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/version-2015-10-03/contents/manifolds.html). It isn't as general as what I describe here but it's far more applicable.*

## Well Defined Concepts
To formally deal with any idea or concept, it has to be well defined. By making our definitions more concrete we can make more precise statements about these ideas. This is how math and science are born.

Take the atom. An atom is a collection of protons, neutrons and electrons which are further composed of elementary particles, all of which are governed by an exact set of equations (i.e quantum mechanics).

A Cesium atom, for example, is thus completely mathematically defined. Everything about it is encapsulated in it's wave function, no need to look at the natural world to understand it.

This applies to all atoms, and thus all molecules, and further anything in the universe made of matter, like humans. This shouldn't come as a surprise. After all, we know that math is the bedrock of science and thus of formal knowledge as a whole.

Take psychology. It is really just applied biology, which is just applied chemistry, which is just applied physics, which is just (as we've seen) applied mathematics.

This *chain of abstraction* applies to all fields of human knowledge, but its relation to psychology and the human mind will be particularly useful to us...

## Bridging the Gap
Now consider the concept of love. It seems impossible to define it objectively right? Sure, it's an evolutionary aid to sexual reproduction, but that's far from concrete and certainly ignores our own experience of it.

- We must first ask ourselves "what is love?"
  - Well it's an emotion, right?
- Sure, but what's an emotion?
  - A state of mind.
- But what is *"the mind"*?
  - The mind arises from the brain processing the information blasted into it via our senses.
- What is the brain made up of, and what comprises its state?
  - The brain is comprised of trillions of specialized cells called neurons. These neurons connect to form large *neural networks* and communicate via electrical activity and chemicals known as neurotransmitters.

And further neurons are comprised of different organelle and so on until we reach atoms and ultimately the fundamental particles of the universe.

This relation between the most fundamental (and very well defined) concepts in our universe, like elementary particles, to the most hazy and abstract ones, like emotions, is what will allow us the bridge the between poorly defined and well defined in a somewhat, admittedly, crude way.

Consider the human brain. It is simply a collection of particles, no? We can represent that collection of particles as a mathematical set. That set will contain a bunch (trillions) of ordered pairs (a,b) where a represents the particle in question (i.e its wavefunction which is a complete description of the particle) and b represents

particles sets, collections possible states, humans consider cat jealousy

#### A Bit More Formal
Making our definition a bit more concrete, we can define any concept as a set of ordered 4-tuples:

$$(p,x,y,z)$$

Where p

## How does this Definition even Help?
Remember when I said formally defining concepts allows us to make formal statements about them? Well that was only partially true. While this 'set of all particle configuration' definition is more formal than your standard notion of jealousy, it's not exactly helpful in trying to understand the nature of emotion of people's interactions with each other.

So then what's the real point? The real point is purely a semantic one. A scientist/philosopher might like to associate some physical meaning to ideas like emotion or creativity. Thus, we can be rest assured that everything imaginable can be considered physical in some sense. Even if that physicality is purely expressed as your brain thinking about said concept, it's still just particles following the same physical laws.
