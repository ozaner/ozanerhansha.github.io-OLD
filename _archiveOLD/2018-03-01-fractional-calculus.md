## Differential Operator
Fractional calculus is best described using the differential operator $D$:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{d} x}f(x)=D[f(x)]=Df\\
\frac{\mathrm{d^n} }{\mathrm{d} x^n}f(x)=D^n[f(x)]=D^nf$$

*Note this operator is only unambiguous when f is a function of one variable*

Also note that the differential operator also includes antidifferentiation, or integration. Thus the indefinite integral of a function $f$ is simply:

$$\int{f(x)}\,\mathrm{d}x=D^{-1}[f(x)]=D^{-1}f$$
$$\underbrace{\int \cdots \int}_{n} f(x) \underbrace{dx \cdots dx}_{n}=D^{-n}f$$
