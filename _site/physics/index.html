  <p>Physics is the branch of science that studies the properties and mechanics of matter and energy in  spacetime and their interaction with the 4 fundamental forces.</p>

<p>There are 3 main divisions of physics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#classical-physics">Classical Physics</a></li>
  <li><a href="#special--general-relativity">Special &amp; General Relativity</a></li>
  <li><a href="#quantum-mechanics-qm">Quantum Mechanics</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="classical-physics">Classical Physics</h3>
<p><a href="/classical-physics">Classical physics</a> is a catch all for the theories of physics that predated the relativistic and quantum theories of physics we have today. They very adequately describe the interactions and mechanics of everyday objects, fluids, gasses, electricity, magnetism, and even celestial bodies.</p>

<p>The 3 main branches of pre-Einsteinian physics are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/classical-physics#classical-mechanics">Classical Mechanics</a></li>
  <li><a href="/classical-physics#classical-electromagnetism">Classical Electromagnetism</a></li>
  <li><a href="/classical-physics#thermodynamics">Thermodynamics</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="special--general-relativity">Special &amp; General Relativity</h3>
<h4 id="special-relativity-sr">Special Relativity (SR)</h4>
<p>When the speeds of the objects being studied approach the speed of light, classical physics no longer suffices to accurately describe physical phenomena. In this case it’s necessary to use Einstein’s theory of special relativity, which is wholly derived from two postulates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating frames of reference.</li>
  <li>The speed of light is constant in all reference frames.</li>
</ul>

<p>The theory models the 3 dimensions of space and 1 dimension of time as a singular 4D spacetime. It explains various high speed phenomena as well the inconsistencies between classical mechanics and the classical theory of electromagnetism.</p>

<p>SR has been widely successful and has even been incorporated with quantum mechanics to form quantum field theory. That said, special relativity doesn’t explain or deal with the force of gravity, keeping spacetime flat rather than curved.</p>

<h4 id="general-relativity-gr">General Relativity (GR)</h4>
<p>This shortcoming led to the theory of general relativity. It generalizes special relativity and Newton’s law of gravitation into a coherent theory where the curvature of spacetime itself becomes responsible for the force of gravity. Unfortunately, unlike special relativity, there has been no successful marriage of general relativity and quantum mechanics. A quantum theory of gravity remains a major goal of modern physics.</p>

<h3 id="quantum-mechanics-qm">Quantum Mechanics (QM)</h3>
<p>When considering matter and energy on very small scales, both classical and relativistic physics break down. This led to the creation of quantum mechanics, which mathematically grounds the mechanics and temporal evolution of subatomic particles. Quantum mechanics itself is not a theory of a particular type of particle like bosons or photons. Think of it as an analogue to classical mechanics which cover the motion and forces that act upon an object.</p>

<h4 id="quantum-field-theory">Quantum Field Theory</h4>
<p>By combining quantum mechanics and special relativity, we are left with a framework for creating quantum theories of subatomic particles. QFTs like quantum electrodynamics and chromodynamics both describe the interactions of a particular type of fundamental force (electromagnetism and the strong nuclear force respectively). These theories, via QM, model particles as perturbations (waves) on an underlying field that permeates all of space.</p>

<!-- #### Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)
Quantum electrodynamics is the QFT of the electromagnetic force. It is the quantum analogue to classical electrodynamics and completely describes the interactions between matter and the electromagnetic force (which is mediated by photons). -->

<!-- #### Electroweak Theory (EWT)
Electroweak theory is a QFT that provides a unified description of both the electromagnetic and weak nuclear force (The weak force being responsible for the radioactive decay of atoms).

EWT is thus a generalization of QED that adds on the weak force. Right after the big bang, the universe was hot enough that these two forces were one indistinguishable force. The theory describes the electroweak force before that time and the separate electromagnetic and weak forces after that time. -->

Quantum chromodynamics is the QFT of the strong nuclear force. This theory describes the interactions between quarks and gluons. The strong nuclear force is the force that keeps the hadrons (which are made up of quarks and gluons) in atomic nuclei bonded together. -->

<h4 id="standard-model-of-physics">Standard Model of Physics</h4>
<p>The Standard Model is the combination of QED, EQT, and QCD into one unified theory of electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force. It is humanity’s ultimate theory of the universe. That said, it still lacks a description of gravity. Such a theory of quantum gravity would allow for the creation of a “Theory of Everything” (TOE) that describes all four fundamental forces in tandem.
