The position/displacement of a particle or object in **space** is defined as a point on an n-dimensional **Cartesian coordinate system**. This point can equivalently be thought of as a vector. Note that displacement is the net, not total, distance traveled by an object in a particular direction.

#### Displacement Function
The displacement function, $$\vec{x}(t)$$ of a object takes a time and outputs its displacement at that time.

Taking the derivative of an object's displacement function with respect to $$t$$ provides the object's [velocity]() function, $$\vec{v}(t)$$:

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\vec{x}(t)=\vec{v}(t)$$

### Classical Physics
In classical physics, a position is a 3-dimensional vector with components $$\left(x,y,z\right)$$.

So in this case, the position function maps from time to real 3-space:

$$s:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$$

The magnitude of displacement, or net **distance**, is calculated the same as any vector:

$$\left|\vec{s}\right|=d=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$$

### Relativity
In relativity, position is only invariant in a particular non-inertial reference frame. This necessitates a notion of position that is invariant with respect to space-time. This 4-dimensional position (3 spatial dimensions and 1 time) is called 4-position, or more commonly as an **event**.

An event is defined as a 4-dimensional vector with components $$\left(t,x,y,z\right)$$. Relativity shows that events that occur at the same time in one reference frame, don't necessarily happen at the same time in another. This is known as **relativity of simultaneity**.

In special relativity the distance between two positions is not invariant in different reference frames. This brings us to the **spacetime interval**. The spacetime interval, $$(\Delta s)^2$$ between two events stays constant in all reference frames:

$$(\Delta s)^2=(c\Delta t)^2-(\Delta \vec{x})^2$$

### Quantum Mechanics
In quantum mechanics, the state of a particle is given, and completely described, by its **wavefunction** $$\psi(\vec{x}, t)$$. With $$x$$ being the a point in space and $$t$$ being a point in time. $$\psi$$ returns a complex valued probability amplitude.

$$\psi:\mathbb{R^4}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$$

The probability of observing a particle at position $$x$$ at time $$t$$ is given by $$\left \| \psi^2 \right \|$$. This implies that for at a given time $$t$$:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left | \psi(\vec{x})^2 \right |dx=1$$

Because the particle has to be somewhere in space, so the probabilities must sum to 1. We integrate from $$-\infty$$ to $$\infty$$ since the particle is a wave spread out over all of space. So, technically, the particle could be anywhere in the universe, it's just unimaginably unlikely.
