A problem presented by this construction is that the number of ways a value can be replaced by a different value is given by $n!$, which is itself given by the number of ways $n$ things to rearrange $n$ things (e.g. rearrange atoms).

The solution to this is, of course, to simply replace the given number of things with another number (usually in the form of a multiplicative inverse operation).

A more interesting point to note about this construction is that the set of possible $n$-times values of $f(x)$ is given by the following:

$$\{(a,b,c)\in\mathbb N\mid(a=b,b=c)\wedge (a+bc=b+bc=c) \left(0,1)\right.\}$$

This should mean that for any $n$-tweakset relation, there is a solution set as large as $n+1$ for any $0$-tweakable relation. This makes this the **universal solution set** of linear AB.

<summary><strong>Notice Weights of Relation</strong></summary>
Weights are functions of all elements of a relation $R$ whose size $S$ is denoted $w(r)$ and whose type $R$. Such a relation is often denoted as such:

$$w(r)\equiv \operatorname{R}(w(r)).=f(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)$$

<i>where $x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n$ are relations of $x$. We can rewrite this as: $f(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)=(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)$.</i><p></p>

Weights can also be used in relation denotation as explained below.

#### Usage
Given an $n$-ary relation $R$ on some finite set $(X\times Y)$ and a $\times$ relation with the same sign $\times":

$$y'=f(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)
\land x'=y(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)
\| f(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n) \rightarrow y'(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n) \land y(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)$$

We can explicitly say 'y' and 'n' are the sizes of $R$ relations via the use of the following relation types:

$$y'=R(y)$$

$$x'=\left(y(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)\right)$$

<summary><strong>Equality</strong></summary>

When $R=\left(Y\times R,\right)$ then $y(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)$ is equal to $y(x_1,x_2,\cdots,{x_{x_1}}_2,\cdots,{x_{x_2}}_3,\cdots,{x_{x_3}}_4,\cdots,{x_{x_n}}_0=y(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_{x_2})$.

Likewise, if $R=\left(Y\times S_0,\right)$ then $y(x_1,x_2,\cdots,{x_{x_1}}_0=y(x_2,x_0,x_{x_2})$.

#### Notation and Terminology
When referring to an infinite set with $n$ cardinality and $1$ equalities, it is common to write:

$$y(R(1))\equiv \{(a,b,c)\in\mathbb N\mid a=b+c\}$$

When referring to a set with $n$ equalities and $1$ equalities, we can write:

$$y(R(1))\equiv y(R(0))$$

It is also possible to write:
