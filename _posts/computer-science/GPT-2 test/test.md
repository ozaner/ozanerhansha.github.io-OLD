Now that we have defined the set of all finite sequences of sequence numbers, we can define the set of all finite sequences of sequence numbers with a finite sequence of numbers. It is called an **empty set** because it is empty.

### A Note on Finitary Sequences
A finitary sequence is one that does not have a finite sequence of numbers in it, because the set of all finitary sequences with a finite count is larger than a finitary sequence that lacks numerators. The fact that finitary sequence can have no number of terms also means that the finitary sequence is finitary. Note that finitary sequences are distinct from infinite sequences because finitary sequences have to be finite.

An important distinction to make between finitary sequence and finite sequences is the absence of numbers. That is the difference between infinite sequences and finitary sequences. There is no contradiction between representing a finitary sequence with no numbers or infinite sequences with no numbers. These representations are simply different forms of the same set and have no place in the theory of finite sequences.

### Finitary Descriptions of the Finitary Sequence
An **infinite sequence** as we define it above, is just a series of finite sequence numbers that ends with the first term. We can also think of an infinite sequence $\mathbb{N}(t)$ with elements as finite as $t_0$ and as infinite as $t_n$:
<!-- #### infinity orderings -->

$$\begin{align}
\operatorname{Finite Sequence}&=\mathbb{N}(t) \\
&=\complement(t_0,t_1,\cdots,t_{n-1}})\\
&=t_n\end{align}$$

We can continue defining finite sequences of the finitary sort as we did finite sequences of the cardinal kind:

$$\begin{align}
\operatorname{Finite Sequences}&=\mathbb{N}(t) \\
&=\min_{n-1}^{\infty} \complement(t_{n-1},t_{n-1},t_{-1},t_{n-1},t_{-1}\cdots,t_0,\cdots,t_1,\cdots,t_2,\cdots,t_n)
\end{align}$$

To end a sequence of finitary sequences with a finite number you simply have to count its terms. We can do this because a finite sequence can only be represented as a finite number of terms, or as a product of finite sequences.

### Infinite Sequences
An **infinite sequence** as we define it above, is just a series of infinite sequence numbers that ends with the first term. For finite sequences $(t_0,t_1,\cdots,t_{n-1})\cdots,t_n)$ and infinite sequences $(t_m,t_{c-1}t_{c-1},\cdots,t_{n-1},t_{n-1}\cdots,t_n)$ :

$$\infty(t_{c-1},t_n\wedge t_m\wedge t_n\wedge t_m\wedge t_{c-1}\wedge \cdots,t_s)$$

To end a sequence of infinite sequences with a finite number of terms you simply have to count its terms. We can do this because a finite sequence can only be represented as a finite number of terms, or as a product of finite sequences.

We can use these definitions to define unique finite sequences of different finitary sequences. Below is a table of the orderings of infinite sequences and finitary sequences of the finitary sort up to and including infinity:

$$\begin{align}

{\mu_{n-1}}_1&=\mu_{n}
\mu_{1}\\
\mu_{-1}&=\mu_{n}-1\cdots
\mu_{1}-1\\
\mu_{-1}&=\mu_{n}
\mu_{n-1}\cdots
\mu_{-1}\\
\mu_{n-1}&=\mu_{n}-1\cdots
\end{align}$$
