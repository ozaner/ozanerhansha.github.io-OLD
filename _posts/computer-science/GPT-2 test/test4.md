## What is Logarithmic Calculation?
Logarithmic calculus is concerned with the calculation of linear relationships as a result of a first order [Kuratowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimierz_Kuratowski) transformation. The basic principle is this:

$$\begin{align}
    1-k=k \tag{1}\\
    0=k \tag{0}\\
\text{Cinematic Diffuse of Light}\\
&=\begin{pmatrix}
   2 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
   0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
   1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
   0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
   1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
   0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}$$

(Infinity, $\Omega$):

$$\begin{align}
  \left(\forall i\in \mathbb S_i\right)
  \left(\forall k\in \mathbb S_k\right)
  \left(\forall i\in \mathbb S_i\right)
\end{align}$$


*The above is a description of a limited subset of the naturals. Other sets can be modeled as well.*

## Numerical Stability
## First Derivative
<summary><strong>First Derivative</strong></summary>
The first derivative of a function $f(y)$ is denoted $k_1$, and is a fixed point of $f(y)$ as $k_1$ approaches zero. Thus, the value of a function $f(y)$ is simply its sum of $k_1$ (i.e. it equals $\omega$):

$$\frac{f^{(k_1)}(y)}{k_1}=\frac{0,0}k_1
(0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,
$$

This is the hole that we are trying to fill with some value $y$ so that we can calculate its successor $k_1$ and so on, until we reach the hole $k_n$ which will be filled with the successor of $k_1$. This sequence of events is called the **equivalence sequence**.

Let $a_i=j$. Then we can solve for $k_1$ like so:
<p></p>
We can solve this equation by first isolating the first $n$ terms in $a_i$ and doing some manipulation like summing, or splitting, the terms.

<h4>K-Means and Solutions</h4>
When the sequence is complete, we can compute the successors of each term in the sequence like so:

$$\begin{align}
    \underbrace{\text{If $i=j\rightarrow k_1$}_{i\in I}}+\text{If $i=j\rightarrow k_2$}_{}
\end{align}$$
