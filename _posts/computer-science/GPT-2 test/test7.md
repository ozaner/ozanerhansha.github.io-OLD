The position of a particle or object in **space** is calculated using 4 fundamental forces:

$$\begin{align*}
  (x)&=\vec{x}+\vec{x}_0\\
  (y)&=\vec{y}+\vec{y}_0 \tag{\(\vec{x}\) independent Eq.}\\
  (z)&=\vec{z}+\vec{z}_0 \tag{\(\vec{x}\) independent Eq.}\\
  (a)&=\vec{a}t+\vec{z}_0 \tag{\(\vec{x}\) independent Eq.}\\
  (x^2)&=\vec{x^2}+\vec{x}_0t+\vec{z}_0 \tag{\(\vec{x}\) independent Eq.}\\
  (y^2)&=\vec{y^2}+\vec{x}_0t+\vec{z}_0 \tag{\(\vec{x}\) independent Eq.}\\
\end{align*}$$

As particles approach a mass such that its *position* points towards each other, they cancel out and arrive at a point called $\vec Zero$. This zero is called the **position point**.

Differential Equations
An interesting property of the position $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{x}_0$ is that the distance between them can be calculated and, in some cases, be as small as the distance between two points. This is analogous to the previous point being able to be calculated to an arbitrary degree.

Take the case of a particle that is 1000000x slower than light in one direction. If the light was pointed the other way then the net speed would be $t^2$ or so, but because the particle was facing the light once, the distance between the two must be greater then the length between the light and the particle. This is the **distance between the light and the particle**.

Another example is that of a computer that is partially or fully reflected from the source. Positional navigation using Google Maps can give a reasonably accurate location but, because the particle is generally not oriented the same way as a directional light, the distance between where the light hits and where it never hits is often more then the wavelength of the light.

$$\vec{x}-\vec{x}_0=t^2$$

### The Law of Friction
Another interesting property of the position $\vec{x}$ is its **law of friction**. That is to say, because two vectors follow the same path, no change in position is possible. This is an important property to keep in mind when solving for radii, because a change of $2$ is reflected in 3 equal vectors (hopefully we don't run into this).

$$\vec{x}-\vec{x}_0=nN$$

### The Law of Uniform Circular Polarization
The magnitude of the gravitational force between the center of mass of two objects is given as such:

$$\vec{F_\vec{x}}=\vec{G}$$

- $F_\vec{x}$ is the force of gravity.
- $G$ is the gravitational constant ($6.455x10^{−11} \frac{\text{N}^2}{{\text{m}^2}}$)
- $m$ is one of the masses.
- $x$ is the other mass.

Notice that because the space we refer to as $\vec{x}_0$ is the zeroing vector of $\vec{x}$, the gravitational force between the two objects is effectively canceling out any acceleration across the gap.

$$\vec{x}\vec{x}=\vec{x}_0+\vec{x}_0t+\vec{x}_0$$

- $F_\vec{x}$ is the force of friction.
- $G$ is the gravitational constant ($6.045x10^{−11}$)
