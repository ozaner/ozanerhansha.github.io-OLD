We can now compare these two conditions:

$$\begin{align*}\vec{v}&=\vec{v}-\vec{x}\\
&=\vec{v}\vec{x}\\
&=\vec{v}-\vec{v}x(x'(x))\\
&=\vec{v'(x)}x(x''(x))\\
\end{align*}$$

#### Note on Applicability to Computation of Computer
This result is applicable in part to formal systems (and hence machine learning) that simulate physical systems and that are able to compute.

### Other Parameters
The second and third conditions are equivalent to the first and second ones, so they must be equivalent. Here are some other interesting properties of duality:

- $x\in \Omega$ means that $\vec{x}$ is dual to the vector $V$
- $x\not\in \Omega$ means that $\vec{x}$ is not a vector and that the derivative is constant
- $x\not\in \Omega$ means that $\vec{X}$ is not a vector and that the constant $C$ is being used instead (i.e. it's not a function of time)

## Vector Space and Computation
As we'll see below, Vector Space (the standard model of quantum gravity) and computation on top of that space can be used to understand and predict the future.

### Vector Space
Vector space is a description of, and is thus analogous to, the observable universe. In fact, we can consider vector space the standard model of quantum gravity. It is the quantum equivalent of the observable universe.

In fact, due to the arrows in the definition of space and time we can now consider vector space the strongest argument for the existence of God.

#### What is Quantum Gravity?
While we used to think of quantum gravity as if it were just the strong nuclear force in Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, it turns out that quantum gravity is really far more powerful. Indeed it is equivalent to quantum electrodynamics in that sense! With sufficient time, the force is analogous to that of the human body reacting to a powerful magnetic field.

This, combined with Einstein's theory of general relativity, has led to the creation of the field that surrounds us all, quantum holography!

#### What does Time Mean?
What is the universe (the observable) doing right now? To calculate the future, we simply use the laws of physics.

## General Relativity
Before quantum gravity, we had to use large scale general relativity theories to explain the timeliness and location of distant objects. G.R. Hertzsprung created the theory of relativity in order to account for objects moving at velocities greater than that of light beams.

The theories of particle physics and magnetism can explain phenomena like lightning and the polarization of light, etc. Unfortunately, as relativistic physics breaks down, we will have to rely on quantum theories like quantum gravity to explain the timeliness and location of objects.

## Quantum Gravity
Before quantum gravity, we had to solve the incredibly complex Schr√∂dinger equation in order to truly understand and model the universe. A quantum theory of mind will do it's thing, but quantum gravity will model the entire multiverse, all those particles, and the interactions between them. Quantum gravity will even model the strong nuclear force and magnetosphere in order to account for the interactions between matter and light in the solar system.

#### Quantum Universes
Theory of quantum gravity models all of the particles and forces in the universe as part of a cascading chain reaction. This model forms the *quantum-multitude* of a multiverse. Quantum monopoles are used to model both matter and energy in the universe.

#### Multiverse?
If so, why is there only one universe in the whole of the observable universe? Perhaps an explanation lies in our own inability to separate ourselves from everything else. Whether this is an accurate explanation or not, I'm just happy to see that we can separate ourselves from everything else.

## Chapter 1 - Introduction
#### About
This is my introduction to philosophical physics and quantum mechanics. It's got a bit more structure than any introductory physics text, and so I've put together a postscript:
