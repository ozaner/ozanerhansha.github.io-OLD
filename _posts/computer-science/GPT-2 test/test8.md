### The Escaping the Real World
After I finish this section I will describe how I avoided all this by simply exiting the real world and going back to the complex world of programming in the computer BASIC environment I created.

<!-- #### How I Learned BASIC -->
This is the same as the introductory section, I will describe how i got into BASIC by way of an example.

<!-- #### A Tutorial Introduction to the Language C -->
This is the same as the introductory section, I will describe how i got into BASIC by way of a [*tutorial*](https://www.ibiblio.org/scripts/tutorials/tutorial-184050).

#### The C Programming Language
## Section 1.1

#### Currying
When faced with an ambiguity in a definition of `if`, `while`, `for`, or `return`, the simplest thing a program may do is curry its definition into a desired form. For example, the following is a full blown C program that counts the number of characters in a file *while* reading from the terminal:
~~~ c
#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
  printf("Hello, world");
}
~~~

#### Assignment Return Value
When the code snippet above was run, the output would have read "Hello, world". However, due to the way the C standard library works, the output would have read "Hello, world" instead. Because of this we must explicitly state the return value of the `main()` function as `0` so that we can continue executing the `for` loop.

<summary><h3 class="inline">Exercise 1-7 - Count Whitespace</h3></summary> The following is a program counts the number of spaces in a file without quotes.

~~~ c
#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
  int n = Getc()
  printf("%c
", n);
}
~~~

#### Null Statement
When handling an exception thrown during the compilation of a C program, it is convention to assert the value of `Exception::fatal` rather than output the error message. Here is the output of the `fatal` function:

~~~ c
#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
  printf("hello, world");
}
~~~

## Section 1.3
#### Floating Point
The `<fc` constant in the `printf` statement was added in 7eeab8d24d24dce7eeab23a32b210d24d2a3ab8d2a3a24de4b

When the `printf` statement is placed before a floating point number, it will be appended to the **fatal** expression as well as the value of `exception.c`.
