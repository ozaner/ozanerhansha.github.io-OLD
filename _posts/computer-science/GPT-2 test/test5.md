Picking up where we left off, the next step is to find the derivative of $x$ at any given $y$:

$$\frac{y}{p}y=f(y,y')\frac{p}{p'}$$

Where $f$ is the first order homogenous equation and $p$ is the first order polynomial. Notice that by the left hand side, we have:

$$\frac{p}{p'}=f(y,y)$$

and,

$$\frac{p}{p'}=\frac{p'}{p'}$$

Now we can split the left hand side into two groups of $y$ each with $0$ on both groups. The first group to be split will be the one least sensitive to the third order homogenous equation.

<h4>Picking a Value to Addition</h4>
The first group to be split will be the one least sensitive to the third order homogenous equation. They will be called the <b>strict</b> group

$$\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R}=\frac{1}{2}$$

- $R$ is the position of the point.
- $\mathcal{E}{R}$ is the time it takes to move the point from $0$ to $R$ (the imaginary time).
- $E$ is the object's velocity.
- $R$ is the time it takes to rotate the object (the imaginary time).


## General Info
- $P$ is the position of the point.
- $\mathcal{E}(\frac{1}{2})$ is the time it takes to move the point from $0$ to $R$ (the imaginary time).
- $P(\mathcal{E}(\frac{1}{2})$ is the object's velocity.
- $\mathcal{E}(\frac{1}{2})$ is the time it takes to rotate the object (the imaginary time).


## True x's and False y's
When the time is right, the object will either be in $P$ or $R$-time. Notice that $P$ is right after the time

$n!\cup^2 n$ is defined as follows:

$$n!=\prod_{k=1}^{n}k=1\times2^2\times3^2\times2^2\cdots\times n!$$

Notice that, due to the repeating pattern, the answer to the above equation is never quite {n-k}$ so we can say:

$$\begin{align*}
&n!=\prod_{k=1}^{n}k!=1!\times2!\times3!\times2!\times3!\times2!\times2!\times3!\times2!\times2!\times3!\times2!\times2!\times3!\times2!\times3!\times2!\times3!\times2!\times2!\times3!\times2!\times3!\times2!\times2!\times3!\times2!\times3!\times2!\times3!\times2!\times3!\times2!\times3!
\end{align*}$$

$n!$ is a prime number. Its power $p$ is simply the power of $n$ divided by the number of prime factors of $n$ (i.e $1+p=2$). Its complement is any other prime number. That is to say:

<!-- $$!=\begin{pmatrix} -->
<b>Order of convergence</b> of a function $f(x)$ with respect to $n$ is denoted $OR_OP(f(x))$.
