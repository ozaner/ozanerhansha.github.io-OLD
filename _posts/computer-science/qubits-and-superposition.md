**Qubits**, or quantum bits, are the basic units of quantum information. Qubits are distinct from the ordinary *bits* of classical information theory and come with the many restrictions and abilities afforded by quantum mechanics.

#### Physical Realization
Analogous to how bits are represented by some binary state (i.e. magnetization on a plate, the presence of a voltage, a switch being on or off, etc.), qubits are represented by some binary quantum state. That is, some quantum system that can be represented as a linear combination of two base states. Examples of how this might be implemented include the polarization of a photon or the spin of an electron.

## Normalization
That is, given 3 real numbers, there exists one number such that = 1
