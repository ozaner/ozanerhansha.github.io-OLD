## What is Machine Learning
A program utilizes machine learning when it 'learns' its desired behavior as opposed to being explicitly programmed.

The most common operational definition of machine learning is given by Tom Mitchell (1998):
> "A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance measure $P$ if its performance at tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$."

## Types of Machine Learning
#### Supervised Learning
- Regression
  - Continuous Output
  - Ex. price, temperature, etc.
- Classification
  - Discrete Output/Categories
  - Ex. malignant or benign, handwriting recognition, etc.
- Reinforcement Learning

#### Unsupervised Learning
- Clustering
  - Ex. market segments, news story grouping, etc.
- Non-clustering
  - Cocktail Party Algorithm

#### Other Topics
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision
