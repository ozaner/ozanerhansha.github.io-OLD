Some people say that with maturity comes a grappling with the unfamiliar. An affront/attack/?? on the simple, easy to understand world our once infantile minds have produced. Howwvre some may argue the axact opposite. That it is preciosly ouir childlike wonder that drives us to discover the unkown, and incombrehensible.

Whatever the case, one thing is for sure, curiosty is a uniquely human trait. Sure animals with their basic needs satiated will blah blah. 

Curisoity is an evolutionary trait of animals, sheep, falcons, etc. Humans take it a step beryond. They will strap themselves to a giant exploding cylinder to explore the giant cresecnet in the night sky. But, you miight protest, "space travel can have tangible benefits for the population on day." True but the keyword is one day. niel armstrong, buzz aldrien, mission control, JFK, the governmenet that funded them, and the public that consented to their governeance won't feel be takign advantage of lunar resources anytime soon. But they did cheered for those 2 astronoauts when they landed in the name of man, all the same.

even if it may not mesh well with our worldview, serve any pracitcaal purpose, or even kill us.

Whether climbing the himalayas, developing a thoery of imaginary numbers, or probing the far reaches of the solar system, humans will stay curious, even if it kills them.
