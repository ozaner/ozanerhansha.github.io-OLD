## Assumptions
- It is possible to create a program that can simulate the future from a certain point in time.
- It is possible to record the universe (or a pertinent chunk of it) at a particular instant in time for use in said program.
- It is possible to create a computer that can run said program in a somewhat tractable time.

## s
Imagine one day you come across a program that can simulate the future from some starting point, and a method to collect the data necessary. How you got these things is unimportant (maybe you are genius polymath or maybe some advanced alien species dropped it out of their spaceship).

You fire up your PC to try and find the lottery numbers but, unfortunately, your puny 4 core desktop is not nearly enough to run such a program and so you head over to the nearest supercomputer and somehow convince the scientists there that you can simulate the future.

Even more unfortunately, it turns out such a simulation would require far more computing power than your supercomputer would allow. But you have a brilliant idea. The super computer, with its limited power, can simulate things a year or two into the future

## Simulation of the Simulator





basically show that the assumptions are false given that predicting th future can lead to a causailty loop, also say that sure quantum effects are the easiest scapegoat but there might be a more fundemntal physical restriction to even approximating the future due to causaility.

Also machines are just particles so they shouldn't be unsimualtable in the same way plants or rocks are not unsimulatable
