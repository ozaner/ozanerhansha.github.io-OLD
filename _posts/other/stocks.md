## Bonds
**Bonds** are just a way for a company to borrow money from you the creditor. They must be paid back in full with interest after some amount of time. Bonds take legal precedence over stocks in the event of bankruptcy. These are used if the company is confident it can pay the bond holder back, i.e. that they can grow the company with this upfront bond money.

## Stock
A **stock** is a share of a company issued by that company. For major shareholders, this allows them to vote and make bigger decisions regarding the future of the company.

For regular shareholders, stocks hold value in the profit, or **dividends**, they pay out or. Another possibility is that the company reinvests all profits back into the cooperation. In this case the value is coming from the stock itself, which is (hopefully) growing in value.

There are two main types of stock:
- **Common Stock**: Majority of stock is common. Given voting rights and a claim on profits.
- **Preferred Stock**: No voting rights and can be bought back (i.e. **callable**) but are guaranteed a fixed dividend in perpetuity. Precedence over common stock in event of bankruptcy.

## Raising Money as a Company
Corporations can raise money either by issuing stock and having people buy it directly (when a company offers their own shares it is on the *primary market*, when you buy stock from someone else it is off the *secondary market*) or they can raise money by issuing bonds. The government, for example, issues long term bonds. These are very safe as the US govt. isn't going anywhere anytime soon...

Initial public offerings (IPOs) is a special case of corporations issuing stock to sell. This is when a company first sells it shares to the public via the stock market.

## Risk
Some investments are riskier than others:
$$\text{Bonds}\gt\underbrace{\text{Preferred}\gt\text{Common}}_{\text{Stock}}\gt\text{Options}$$

*$a>b$ means $a$ is safer than $b$.*

- Bonds are the least risky since they have legal precedence over stocks and are guaranteed interest.
- Stocks are more risky than bonds as the stock is not guaranteed to grow in value and may very well decrease considerably. However, it is less risky than options since they will always have (except under bankruptcy) intrinsic value somewhat close to the original buying price barring possibly large changes in price.
- Options are the riskiest of the three since the entire entry cost  you put in may be totally lost if your prediction (whether the stock would rise or lower or some combination of the two) wasn't correct. Moreover it will also be lost even if the stock stayed stagnant or only slightly raised/lowered (in the case of regular puts and calls). Options, then, are bets on the change in price over time, or **derivatives**, of stocks.

However, the less risky an investment is, the less profit is (generally) made from them. Stocks for example have returned 8-10% historically while bonds have only done 5-7%.

## Stock Markets
Stock markets are places where shareholders can trade and sell stocks with each other. These are *secondary markets* as no transactions here involve the actual companies whose stock is being traded (bar special cases like stock buy back or issuing new shares).

We can talk about *the* stock market, however, because all the big stock exchanges are now much more integrated and cohesive due to the advent of telecommunications and, more recently, the internet. This leads to a greater pool of sellers and buyers and thus more standard/fair prices and higher liquidity.

## Regulation
Stock markets are self-regulated organizations (SROs). That is, they are non-governmental agencies that create and enforce industry standards and regulations. The **Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)** regulates stock markets in order to ensure that they are fair for all parties involved in trading.

Even further, the **US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** is the independent agency of the federal government (outside of the control of the executive branch) responsible for enforcing and proposing laws on stock markets and exchanges.

## Liquidity, Spread, and Depth
In order to make trades on the stock market, a buyer has to find a seller who agrees with their price. The more willing buyers and sellers there are of a stock, the more **liquidity** that stock is said to possess. This property allows the stock to be traded much easier and is important for an effective stock market. Since a willing buyer/seller may not exist at any given moment, stock markets may rely on middlemen that maintain continual trades. These middlemen are called **market makers**.

Since stocks are sole with seller setting an *offer* and a buyer giving an *offer* there is usually a discrepancy between these two quantities, due to the two parties valuing the stock/instrument differently. This discrepancy is called the **spread** of the stock. Note that the lower the spread and the larger the bids and offers are, the more liquid the stock is. When there are many buyers and sellers whose offers/bids are at many different prices, the stock is said to have good **depth**.

Note that the terms liquidity and depth also apply to the stock market as a whole rather than just stocks. A good stock (like those of large companies) are ones with high liquidity and good depth. Likewise, a good stock market is one whose stocks possess these qualities.

## Indices
An index is an aggregated representation of a number of companies' stock prices. For example, the S&P 500 is a weighted average of the largest 500 publicly traded companies in the US. Its movement, then, is a quantification of the health of the US economy and stock market as a whole. When people refer to the stock market as a whole they are referring to some large index. There are also smaller indices that only take into count specific industries like oil, technology, chip manufacturing, etc.

While indices are theoretical tools, they can be realized into **exchange traded funds (ETFs)**. Big companies essentially buy the correct proportions of each stock as prescribed by the index in question and sell them as a sort of 'stock' that one can buy, sell, put, call and so on.
