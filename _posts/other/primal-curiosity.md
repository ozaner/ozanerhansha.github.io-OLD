Dialogue between two people. Nature of computation, primitive curiosity (fed sheep/falcon) no different from other survival emotions (we aren't floating intellects), totality in knowledge(fruitless task)

curisosity and intelelgence is no more noble than love and sex, fear and justice, anger and hatred. Pesonhood is all there is. There sis no stae of being above all others, no truth in knowlegde. It sis foolosh to imagine such a romantisiced meta physics such that the enlgihtment philosphes did.
