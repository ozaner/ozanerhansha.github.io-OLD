### Winning Cutscene
when entire game is won, cutscene starts where player aims tachyon gun at losers head and shoots. gun fires but half way between gun and loser's head it dissapears. then it cuts (or rewinds through the game with a timer showing how long the game took) to the beginning of the game with the 3 2 1 start. Only this time at 1 or 2 a bullet appears and kills the loser before he could even start. Then it says WINNER. and that's it.
