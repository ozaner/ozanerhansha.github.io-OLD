## Hypercomputation in the real world?
#### Regarding the spectral mass gap
The paper "Undecidability of the Spectral Gap" by Cubitt, et al. demonstrates an undecidability result for some *limiting* physical system (i.e. not for any finite system but what those systems approach as their size -> infinity). Below is a great blog post by Scott Aaronson on why this doesn't have any bearing on the CTD principle and why its no more surprising (from a computer scientists perspective) then the halting problem (i.e. the Turing machine is a limiting system of finite state machines) being undecidable:

And so we are safe form any physical process involving an uncomputable result.

#### Regarding General Relativistic Hypercomputers
CTCs, M-H spacetimes, and rotating black holes being used for hypercomputation are probably disallowed by quantum gravity.

- CTCs are thought to not be able to exist bc of it (CTCs are troublesome on their own). and M-H spacetimes also probably don't exist.
- *I* think quantum gravity disallow rotating black holes to be used because the event horizon is a 2D surface but any computing device takes up some volume. You couldn't keep the entire device exactly on the event horizon to complete the calculation. Also about the paper's talk about getting arbitrarily close to it, if its less than $10^{-35}m$ then it is no longer in the realm of general relativity but of quantum gravity.
- Also hold on, these above contraption require *Turing machines*, that is they have infinite storage space. Those already don't exist and don't have any bearing on CTD. Of course, any physical system is finite, so it can be computed in principle simply via brute force.

#### Quantum Harmonic Oscillator
A quantum harmonic oscillator has an uncountably infinite number of base quantum states. Using these as qu$d$its where $d=2^{\aleph_0}$, could we achieve hypercomputation? Surely not...
