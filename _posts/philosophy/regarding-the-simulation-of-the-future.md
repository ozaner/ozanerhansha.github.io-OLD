## Assumptions
- It is possible to create a program that can simulate the future from a certain point in time.
- It is possible to record the universe (or a pertinent chunk of it) at a particular instant in time for use in said program.
- It is possible to create a computer that can run said program in a somewhat tractable time.

## s
Imagine one day you come across a program that can simulate the future from some starting point, and a method to collect the data necessary. How you got these things is unimportant (maybe you are genius polymath or maybe some advanced alien species dropped it out of their spaceship).

You fire up your PC to try and find the lottery numbers but, unfortunately, your puny 4 core desktop is not nearly enough to run such a program and so you head over to the nearest supercomputer and somehow convince the scientists there that you can simulate the future.

Even more unfortunately, it turns out such a simulation would require far more computing power than your supercomputer would allow. But you have a brilliant idea. The super computer, with its limited power, can simulate things a year or two into the future

//new april 1st 2019 finishing this up maybe

so you simulate the future to a limited scale in order to mimic their technological advances. Now you have their advances and can start building a better more capable computer now. rinse and repeat and now you've got a super computer that can simualte the future very far and methods to collect data just by peeking into the future.

ultiamte interpretation: there is no contradiction here. that knolwegde did come from somewhere and not some closed loop. You simulated what we would think and do in the future and just used it. nothing weird about that. waittttt

you simualting the future includes yourself simulating the future ad infinitum. This all makjes sense if yo simuated a universe where you DIDNT simualte the universe, but in one where you did? you'd begetting the info from the guy simualting who'd be doing the same and so on.

underlying issue of simulating a computer that simuilatesa computer... In real world virtual machines do have alimit of depth, but with a computer that simulates all matter irrespective of what its doing, living, breathing, computing, what would happen? saimualting a computer is no different from simualting a man walking. and if that simulated computer is an instance of the computer doing the siomulation, you've got turtles all the way dowbn.

## Simulation of the Simulator





basically show that the assumptions are false given that predicting th future can lead to a causailty loop, also say that sure quantum effects are the easiest scapegoat but there might be a more fundemntal physical restriction to even approximating the future due to causaility.

Also machines are just particles so they shouldn't be unsimualtable in the same way plants or rocks are not unsimulatable

i think the problem is that any simualtor of n particles cant simualte something of greater than n particles. this would lead to an explosion of computing power fomr nothing. so a computer can't simulate itselfwithout a performance hit.

but wait only one perforamnce hit and the simulating below gets a performance hit and so on...? geometric progression towards halt? whjat the hell am i talking about
