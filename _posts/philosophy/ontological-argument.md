## Definition of God
God is *the* supreme being that created the universe. Traditionally God is ascribed the qualities of omniscience (all-knowing), omnipotence (all-powerful), and omnibenevolence (wholly good).


## Stances on God
There can be three stances on this God:

- Theist: Someone who believes that God exists.
- Atheist: Someone who believes that God does not exist.
- Agnostic: Someone who suspends judgement about the existence of God.

*We are ignoring considerations of polytheism and eastern-esque religions as they can be put into similar terms.*

## Differing Justifications
Pragmatic reasoning vs. epistemic reasoning
