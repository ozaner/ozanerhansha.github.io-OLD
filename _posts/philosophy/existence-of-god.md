The existence of God is a very important aspect of culture and society and has affected humanity for as long as we've existed. It is no surprise then, that arguments for/against God are staples of philosophy. Below we detail some, historically, major arguments for and against the existence of God as well as some terminology.

#### Unfalsifiability
Arguments for God, and even against God, are usually ineffective. Indeed, nowadays most people consider the existence of God to be unfalsifiable, that is God's existence cannot be proven nor disproven. Despite this however, many still believe that proving that God is likely/unlikely to exist is still a worthwhile exercise.

## Definition of God
Different conceptions of *God* or an all powerful figure have existed throughout human history. Some monotheistic conceptions posit a singular supreme being that stands above all others (Abrahamic religions), some polytheistic conceptions posit multiple deities that exist simultaneously (like Hinduism), and some are less explicit like the Buddhist conception of Samsara.

Despite all these different conceptions of God, most ontological arguments (at least from the western world) aim to prove the monotheistic conception. As a result we will take the following to be our working definition of God:

>**God** is *the* supreme being that created the universe. God is traditionally ascribed the qualities of omniscience (all-knowing), omnipotence (all-powerful), and omnibenevolence (wholly good).

While this definition does severely limit our scope, it is usually the case that arguments assuming this definition can be generalized to other conceptions of God as well.

## Stances on God
There can be three stances an interlocutor may hold on this God:

- Theist: Someone who believes that God exists.
- Atheist: Someone who believes that God does not exist.
- Agnostic: Someone who suspends judgement about the existence of God.

*Again we are ignoring considerations of polytheism and eastern-esque religions as they can be put into similar terms.*

## Differing Justifications
Pragmatic reasoning vs. epistemic reasoning


cosmological arg infinity minusi inifnity refelctive of a lack of modern mathmatical kolwekdge. like asking whats x-y there is simply not enough ifnromation. question like infinityminus infintiy arise in calcaus when taking limits blah blah cardinality blah. Dumb people dumb objections.

cosmological kicking the can down farther. if god had to cause the big bang why coudlt the big bang just be if god just is. what caused god.
