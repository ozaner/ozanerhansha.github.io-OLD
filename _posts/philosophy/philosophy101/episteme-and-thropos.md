## Ethics
b: hey professor!
a: oh Thropos, how are you? Do you need something?
b: i'm fine thanks, and yeah I wanted to ask you something.
a: shoot.
b: during class you were talking about 'ethics', and 'morality' but what do those words even mean?
a: well, what do you think they mean?
b: well I assume they refer to the codification of actions as either 'good' or 'bad'. But that's obviously an oversimplification.
b: then tell me, what does it mean to be ethical?
a:

## Side thing: greek theory of vision (lasers coming out of eyes)
a: well he was mostly correct, he could just cut out the shooting laser ebam part, because there are laser beams all around us pervading the huge volume of space.
b: i guesss that is crazy.
b thinks its stupid but a shows her that its not stupid and clever he the greek got taht far and shows its actually crazy that the alser beam thign ISNT true.

## Aesthetics

## Free will

## Love
b: but don't you have a wife.
a: thats right I've been happily maarried for 7 years now!
b: but if love is meaningless--
a: ahh ahh i didnt say it was meaningless i said...

## Personhood
b: we talk about humanity and mankind but what does it mean to be human.
a: you could probably define quite concetly via our genome, no?
b: you know that's not what I meant.
a: I think the distinction you are trying to make is that of personhood vs. humanity.
b: aren't all humans people? and aren't all people human? why make the distinction?
a: well

## Science
bad and good, knowledge, perception, truth,, epistomogoly, what were doign right now no?



####name
so in all these past conversations we've had, a general theme is that man is a product of evolution and from that much of our notions of ethics,
a: man rose from the dirt and thus philosophy has as well.
b: nice quote:
a: thanks!
b: well i've been thinking about calling that whole idea 'evolutionary philsophy' kinda like evolutionary psychology which looks at human psychology from the perspective of evolution. (elaborate more there)
a: I think that's a fine name. And I'd wager that evolutionary psychology contains many useful insights into our 'evolutionary philosophy'
b: our?
a: of course! any dialouge is a two way street. Its even got di- in the word!
b: ha.
a: anyway what were you saying....
b: right, well...

#### Final conversation
b: are you telling me all our conversations, all these conclusions, these 'truths' we've unconvered, they all lead to their own  demise? That we would have been better off not thinking of these questions in the first place?
a: Perhaps. ignorance is bliss, no?
b: you're kidding me. you're the last person who would throw some trite platitude my way.
a: well there IS an alternate conclusion we can make. Consider for a moment why we've had these conversations. why we seek,
a: then we can come to a compromise: for people who won't ever consider such questions of 'evolutionary philsophy' and its implications, they are better off not doing so. But for people who wonder "whats the point of it all" maybe it was fruitful for them to finnaly lay these doubts to rest and making peace with their, perhaps, painful conclusions.
a: or maybe... we're just over thinking it. maybe its just fun to pass the time thinking about this crap. you and me, we're going to die one day, and since we're not going to kill ourselves, we may as well live life in a way to optimizes our own enjoyment.
b: you mean have fun?
a: yeah. now come on, lets get some lunch, im starving!



a: oh cheer up all of you. dont you get it? its precioscly becquse of this philsophy our inescapab;e humanitym mortality that we can be happy. we have no gods to please, all we have is ourselves and those we choose to fill our need for social interaction. Those people arent puppets to assuage our reptillian brain and youre certainly not puppets of the universe. Well maybe that last one is true, but it doesnt matter, youre all you can be: a wandering thinking human whatever we define that to be. so either live your life as you please, or kill yourself. there is no in between. class dismissed.
