why dont i shit in peoples cars punch homeless people steal etc.
is it because i have some unique insight into the moral objhective. Some cosmic truth that other people may not?

of course not this is absurd. (why people may belive in this though implicitly or explciity is of interest and is discussed furhter below) then why? well its obvious. we all know it. we are products of biology. the actions i make arent JUST becase i actively and rationaly consider the ramifcaitions of all my actions. its notjust because i fear punishment fromt he state for breakign the alw or disdain form my peers for breakign social customs.

its mainly because i a a product of evolution and of culture. im naturally averse to seeing blood, naturally averse to unwarrented confluct, and soo too is the society i was reaised in. there are exceptions of course. both for me and others. symptoms fo the natuarla variation and imperfection of nature and proof that society can't penetrate all of our lives to the fllest extent.

#### why we like to beleive in moral truth

#### the conlusion of anyh ethoical discussion
by the very nature of ethics then, nothing true or real can be agreed upon in  such arguments. it will always be one person unfoundedly asserting one moral acgtion is 'good' and another is bad. neither has justification beyod simply assserting it.

ethics can be scientifically studied. mainly in the form of anthorpology and evolitionary biology. where do values and norms come form? curisotty, love, freedom, fairness, equlaity, etc. We can study we we like to beleive in these unfounded and hazy imuttive cincepts. we can study these coneptgs on rtheier own as real and logical udeas because they arent real. there is no objective morality. its a delusion we tell ourselvs because iof section 2
