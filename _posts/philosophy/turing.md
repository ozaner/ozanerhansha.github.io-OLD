## 1. The Imitation Game
Turing wastes no time in posing the question of interest: "Can machines think?" but then immediately points out that key to this question is the definition of 'machine' and 'think'. To avoid the murky issue of nailing down such definitions, Turing proposes an experiment called the *imitation game* or, as we know it today, the **Turing test**. The rules of the game are quite simple:

- There are two players A and B and an interrogator C.
- One of the two players is a computer and the other a human.
- It is the interrogator's job (also a human) to determine which of the two is the computer and which the human.
- To that end, the interrogator is able to communicate with A and B via text (a chatroom, teleprompter, etc.) and ask them any question they please.

It is with this Turing test that we can rephrase our initial question of "Can a machine think?" to the more unambiguous "Can a machine fool the interrogator into thinking it is a human?" This, of course, still leaves 'machine' undefined but Turing addresses that in part 3.

## 2. Critique of the New Problem
Here Turing explains that doing the test over text abstracts away the physical formalities of fooling a human to thinking a machine is a robot. Remember, we are concerned with the "intellectual capacities of a man" not the physical ones. Of course the interrogator can question the players physical aspects but the player is under no obligation to tell the truth.

Another important point here is that there may be some game theoretic trickery going on with the game leading to the best strategy for the computer not being to imitate a human. While this seems unlikely, we will simply assume that the computer best strategy to be labeled a human by the interrogator is to imitate one.
