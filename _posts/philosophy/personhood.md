Persondom, humanness, distinct. A sentient alien is no human but certaoinly a person. Person rights? consciouness something to be respected? why care about sentience? what'sthe difference between pig and fly? how cute they are? pain? how about fish? nervous systems? We draw the line at nbrevious systemns? thats a strange place to do so.

### Humanisitc view
What are you talkjing about ozaner! your insane! of course these are people and of course we shouldnt harm arnimals. You're using the mentally diabled as justification for animal rights? Why not just respect animals you meanie?

Fair point, what is the point of all this philsophy if we are simply to return to our own lives unpertruebd and thinking the same thigns blah b blah

### arbitrary line
a more 'logical' argumenty (not that the above wasn';t logical (in fact i think th ebaove is very logical, we must not forget that we are humans and that we are doign this philosphy for a purpose. If it causes harm and no good, why are we even discussing it(be less goodie tooshoes about that))) would be sure ants are simple minided createues to us, and so too may be the mentally impaired, but thats just because we stand on a slightly higher rung in the ladder of 'intellegence' whatever that is. Whose to say that an intellegence far more complex than ours can't exist and that we are simply ants in the views of these intellegences?
