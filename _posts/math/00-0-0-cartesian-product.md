## Definition
The Cartesian product $\times$ is an operation on two sets, call them $A$ and $B$, that returns the set of all [ordered pairs](/n-tuples) with their first element from $A$ and their second from $B$.

$$A\times B=\{(a,b)\mid a\in A \land b\in B\}$$

#### Existence in ZFC
Utilizing the [Kuratowski definition](/n-tuples#definition) of ordered pairs, we can show that the Cartesian product of two sets can be constructed from the axioms of ZFC. In particular, it is a subset of the following easily constructed set:

$$A\times B \subseteq \mathcal{P}\left(\mathcal{P}\left(A\cup B\right)\right)$$

<details><summary><strong>Proof</strong></summary>
First, note that $A\cup B$ is guaranteed by the axiom of union and that its power set is guaranteed by the axiom of power set.

Next notice that, among many other elements, the power set of $A\cup B$ contains:
<!-- \left(\forall a\in A,\forall b\in B\right) -->
$$\{a\},\{a,b\}\in\mathcal{P}\left(A\cup B\right)$$

where $a$ and $b$ are elements in $A$ and $B$ respectively. Now if we take the power set again we'll see that the result contains, among other things, the elements:

$$\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}\in\mathcal{P}\left(\mathcal{P}\left(A\cup B\right)\right)$$

for all $a$ and $b$ in $A$ and $B$. Now invoke the axiom of subset to choose only those elements that fit the description and we are done!

<!-- $A\cup B$ is guaranteed by the axiom of union, and its repeated power sets are guaranteed by the axiom of power set. This coupled with the fact that the Cartesian product is only a subset of the above expression implies that it must exist. -->

## $n$-ary Cartesian Product
It is easy to see how one might generalize this notion to $n$ sets. By simply chaining the Cartesian product we are left with a set of $n$-tuples:

$$\begin{align*}(S_0\times S_1)\times S_2&=\{(\left(s_0,s_1),s_2\right)\mid\forall k\in 3,\ s_k\in S_k)\}\\
&=\{\left(s_0,s_1,s_2\right)\mid\forall k\in 3,\ s_k\in S_k)\}
\end{align*}$$

Repeating this $n$ times, we are left with the following for any $n$ sets:

$$S_0\times S_1\times \cdots \times S_{n-1}=\{\left(s_0,s_1,\cdots,s_{n-1}\right)\mid\forall k\in n,\ s_k\in S_k)\}$$

*Notice that the parenthesis are omitted. This is because the cartesian product is left-associative, a property that is expounded upon further below.*

#### Cartesian Powers
When dealing with the repeated Cartesian product of a single set $S$, we call it the $n$th Cartesian power and use the following notation:

 $$\underbrace{S\times S \times \cdots \times S}_{n\text{ sets}}=S^n$$

#### Infinitary Products
The arity of a Cartesian product is the number $n$ of sets that are being multiplied. When $n$ is infinite the product is **infinitary** as opposed to **finitary** for finite $n$.

$$\underbrace{\text{binary},\text{trinary},\cdots,n\text{-ary}}_{\text{finitary}}\cdots;\underbrace{\aleph_0\text{-ary},\aleph_1\text{-ary},\cdots}_{\text{infinitary}}$$

All the definitions used above apply only to finite $n$. There *are* valid notions of infinitary Cartesian products, but they are beyond the scope of this post.

## Properties
### Ordering Properties
<!-- #### Non-Commutative -->
<details>
<summary><h4 class="inline">Non-Commutative</h4></summary>
The Cartesian product is a non-commutative operator:

$$A\times B \not= B \times A$$

This should be obvious as the ordered tuples $(a,b)\not=(b,a)$ where $a\in A$ and $b\in B$ via the definition of <a href="/n-tuples#equality">tuple equality</a>.
<p></p>
</details>

<!-- #### Non-Associative -->
<details>
<summary><h4 class="inline">Non-Associative</h4></summary>
The Cartesian product is a non-associative operator:

$$\left(A\times B\right) \times C \not= A\times \left(B \times C\right)$$

Similar to its non-commutativity, we can illustrate this by noting that $((a,b),c)\not= (a,(b,c))$ where $a\in A$, $b\in B$, and $c\in C$.
<p></p>
</details>

<!-- #### Left-Associative -->
<details>
<summary><h4 class="inline">Left-Associative</h4></summary>
When faced with an $n$-ary Cartesian product, it is conventionally evaluated from left to right. That is to say the Cartesian product is left-associative:

$$A\times B \times C=(A \times B)\times C$$

This convention agrees with the definition of $n$-ary Cartesian products and $n$-tuples.

### Distributive Properties
<!-- <details>
<summary><h3 class="inline">Distributive Properties</h3></summary> -->
$$\begin{gather*}
A\times\left(B\cup C\right)=\left(A\times B\right)\cup \left(A\times C\right)\tag{Union}\\
A\times\left(B\cap C\right)=\left(A\times B\right)\cap \left(A\times C\right)\tag{Intersection 1}\\
\left(A\times B\right)\cap \left(C\times D\right)=\left(A\cap B\right)\times \left(C\cap D\right)\tag{Intersection 2}\\
A\times\left(B\setminus C\right)=\left(A\times B\right)\setminus \left(A\times C\right)\tag{Set Difference}\\
B\subseteq C\iff\left(A\times B\right)\subseteq \left(A\times C\right)\tag{Subset 1}\\
\left(A\times B\right)\subseteq \left(C\times D\right)\iff\left(A\subseteq B\right)\land \left(C\subseteq D\right)\tag{Subset 2}\\
\end{gather*}
$$

<!-- <h4>Union</h4>
$$A\times\left(B\cup C\right)=\left(A\times B\right)\cup \left(A\times C\right)$$

<h4>Intersection</h4>
$$A\times\left(B\cap C\right)=\left(A\times B\right)\cap \left(A\times C\right)$$

$$\left(A\times B\right)\cap \left(C\times D\right)=\left(A\cap B\right)\times \left(C\cap D\right)$$

<h4>Set Difference</h4>
$$A\times\left(B\setminus C\right)=\left(A\times B\right)\setminus \left(A\times C\right)$$

<h4>Subsets</h4>
$$B\subseteq C\iff\left(A\times B\right)\subseteq \left(A\times C\right)$$

$$\left(A\times B\right)\subseteq \left(C\times D\right)\iff\left(A\subseteq B\right)\land \left(C\subseteq D\right)$$

<h4>Complements</h4> -->
If $A$ and $B$ are members of some universal set $U$, then their absolute complement is denoted $A^C$ and $B^C$ respectively.

$$\left(A\times B\right)^C=\left(A^C\times B^C\right)\cup\left(A^C\times B\right)\cup\left(A\times B^C\right)\tag{Complement}$$

## Examples
#### Relations
[Relations](\relations) from a set $A$ to a set $B$ are defined, in part, as subsets of the Cartesian product $A\times B$. For example, the less than or equal to relation $\le$ on the integers can be defined like so, with the third element being a subset of the cartesian product of te first two:

$$\le\equiv\{\cdots,\left(1,2\right),\left(-14,0\right),\left(5,5\right),\left(12,13\right),\cdots\}$$

And so, because $10$ is less than $12$, the ordered pair $(10,12)\in\le$. We can write this more conventionally as $10\le12$.

*This glosses over some nuance regarding the notation of relations and the specification of their domain and codomain.*

#### Cardinal Multiplication
Cartesian products are used to define the product of two cardinal numbers:

$$\left|X\right|\left|Y\right|=\left|X\times Y\right|$$

#### Cartesian Coordinates
Every point in $2$-space represents an element of the Cartesian product of the Reals with themselves (i.e $\mathbb{R}^2$). This can be generalized to $n$-space with every point being an element of $\mathbb{R}^n$:

$$\mathbb{R}^n=\{(x_0,x_1,\cdots,x_{n-1})\mid \forall k\in n:   x_k\in\mathbb{R}\}$$

*Indeed, the graphical representation above was dubbed the Cartesian plane after the same [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren√©_Descartes) that used it to represent the Cartesian product $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$.*

Points in $3$-space are necessary in describing the [position](/position) of objects and particles in space and thus set up the study of [motion](\kinematics), the causes of that motion and, ultimately, the rest of physics.

Moreover, $2$-space (and less frequently $3$-space) is used in plotting and making inferences from data as well as visualizing functions over an interval of numbers.
