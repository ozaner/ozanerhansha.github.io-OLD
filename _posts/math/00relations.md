We can consider a **relationship** between $n$ variables a predicate with $n$ free variables:

$$P(x_1,x_2,x_3,\cdots,x_n)$$

That is, given a particular choice of $n$ variables, the relationship $P$ may either be true or false.

If we limit the domain of each variable $x_i$ in the predicate as belonging to some corresponding set $S_i$, we can define the solution set $G$ to the relationship $P$ as follows:

$$G=\{(x_1,x_2\cdots,x_n)\in S_1,S_2\times\cdots\times S_n\mid P(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)\}$$

We can now extend the idea of relationships to set theory by constructing a **relation** between those $n$ sets which will be characterized by the solution set $G$, commonly called its **graph**.

## Definition
An **$n$-ary relation** $R$ is an $(n+1)$-tuple of $n$ sets $S_1,S_2,\cdots,S_n$ and a subset of their cartesian product (called the graph) $G\subseteq S_1\times S_2\times\cdots\times S_n$:

$$R\equiv(S_1,S_2,\cdots,S_n,G)$$
