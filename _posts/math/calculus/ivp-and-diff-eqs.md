The **general solution** of an IVP is the solution of the differential equation but includes some constant $c$ that depends on the **initial condition**.

A differential equation is **separable** iff it can be written as the product of a function of the *independent variable* $t$ and a function of its *dependent variable* $y$:

$$\frac{dy}{dt}=f(t,y)=g(y)h(t)$$

An **autonomous** differential equation is a special type of seperable function which only depends on the *dependent variable*:

$$\frac{dy}{dt}=f(t,y)=g(y)$$


When solving a diff eq by seperation be sure to first identify all constant solutions (y) where g(y)=0 as they are lost when diving by g(y).
