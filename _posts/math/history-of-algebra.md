## History of Algebra
The earliest forms of Algebra have been around since [Diophantus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantus) (3rd century Greek mathematician) who, breaking from the Greek tradition of geometry, used symbols to represent unknowns. In his book *Arithmetica* Similar to how we use $x$ today to represent an unknown variable, Diophantus used the Greek letter sigma $\varsigma$.

Algebra as we know it wouldn't appear until Al-Khwārizmī, a medieval Persian polymath, wrote his famous treatise, the [*Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing*](http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/MBP/robertofchesters00khuw.pdf). Its Arabic name is equally as large and so is shortened to *Al-Jabr* which translates to "the reunion of broken parts". In fact the word algebra itself comes from this book (Al-Jabr --> Algebra). Indeed it was this book that introduced the same notions of canceling and balancing equations to solve for $x$ that we use today.

What was so vital about this work was that it was the first to **abstract** away algebra from geometry and arithmetic, establishing it as an independent field of mathematics.

This kind of jump wasn't done again until the 19th century, when mathematician realized that algebra could be considered not just for numbers but for any set of objects, and that there could be many different types of algebra rather than just the one we learn in school. This was the birth of **abstract algebra**, or modern algebra.

<!-- ## Algebraic Structures
Just like how geometry studies shapes and forms or arithmetic studies numbers and doing operations on them, abstract algebra studies algebraic structures and their construction. These structures have important applications both in pure math as well as sciences like physics and chemistry.

An algebraic structure is an [$n$-tuple](/n-tuples) of a **set** and one or more **operations** on that set.

Some examples of algebraic structures:
* Group
* Rings
* Field
* Vector Space
* Boolean Algebra -->
