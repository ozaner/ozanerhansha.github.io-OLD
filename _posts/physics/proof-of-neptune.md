## The Discovery of Neptune
#### Pre-discovery
Unlike all the planets up to Uranus, Neptune (â™†) is not visible to the naked eye from earth. This is why it wasn't ever seen by humans until Galileo Galilei spotted it in 1613 with his telescope. However, Galileo did not recognize that Neptune was a planet and thought it was a star that was fixed in the sky.
