Classical physics refers to the branches of physics that were conceived of prior to quantum mechanics and Einsteinian relativity. These branches of physics are still widely applicable today and serve as starting points for understanding and deriving modern physics.

## Classical Mechanics
Classical mechanics is the study of the motion of massive bodies. It is usually split into two main branches:

- [Kinematics](/kinematics) - The description of translational motion through space. Other types of motion include:
  - Rotational Kinematics
  - Simple Harmonic Motion (Oscillatory Motion)
- Dynamics - The causes of motion. Main topics include:
  - Forces
  - Work, Power & Energy
  - Linear Momentum
  - Rotational Dynamics

### Reformulations
While Newtonian mechanics, as described by the ***principia***, was the first formulation of classical mechanics, there exists others. Namely Lagrangian Mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics. These formulations are instrumental in developing modern theories like quantum mechanics.

## Classical Electromagnetism
Classical electromagnetism studies the properties and interactions of electric charges, magnets, and the electromagnetic force in general. There are 4 main topics here:

- Electrostatics
  - Electric Charge
  - Electric Fields
  - Electric Potential
- Magnetostatics
- Electrodynamics
- Electrical Networks
  - Capacitance
  - Current
  - Resistance

## Thermodynamics
Thermodynamics is the study of the workings d effects of heat, or **thermal energy**, in a system. Some main topics inlude:

- The 4 Laws of Thermodynamics
- Entropy
- Temperature
