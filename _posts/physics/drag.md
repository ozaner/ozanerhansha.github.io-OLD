#### Where does Drag come from?

#### Non-Conservative Force

## Drag Equation
The magnitude of the drag force is given by:

$$F_D=\frac{\rho AC_Dv^2}{2}$$

- $F_D$ is the magnitude of the drag force.
- $\rho$ is density of the fluid.
- $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the object (or more accurately an orthographic projection of the object onto a plane perpendicular to the velocity).
- $C_D$ is the drag coefficient of the fluid.
- $v$ is the magnitude of the velocity.

The direction of drag is opposite that of the object's velocity in the liquid:

$$\hat{\vec{F_D}}=-\hat{\vec{v}}$$

Combining these two equations, we can write the drag force as:

$$\vec{F_D}=\frac{-\rho AC_Dv^2}{2}\hat{\vec{v}}=\frac{-\rho AC_D\|\vec{v}\|}{2}\vec{v}$$

### Drag Coefficient

### Terminal Velocity

### Power to Overcome Drag
We can find the power required to overcome the drag force by the dot product of drag and the velocity of the object. Since

$$P_d=\vec{F_D}\cdot\vec{v}=\frac{\rho v^3C_DA}{2}$$
