Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. This force is felt by all objects with mass (or energy) and is directed towards every other object that feels gravity.

### Large Scale Structure in the Universe


## Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
The law of gravity is a basic tenet of the classical mechanics formulated in Newton's *principia*. The magnitude of the gravitational force between the center of mass of two objects is given as such:

$$F_g=G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$

- $F_g$ is the magnitude of gravity.
- $G$ is the gravitational constant ($6.674×10^{−11} \frac{\text{Nm}^2}{\text{kg}^2}$)
- $m_1$ is one of the masses.
- $m_2$ is the other mass.
- $r$ is the distance between the two point masses.

Note that the above force is being exerted by each object on the other, so it gives a pair of force vectors. The direction of these vectors are simply towards the objects
