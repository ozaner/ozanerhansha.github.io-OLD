Is there anything that distinguishes us from computational systems?

If we are referring to the machine I'm typing on, or any modern computer, then certainly. We are far more complicated in a variety of dimensions compared to any dumb old computer. Yet if by computational system we mean to say any Turing machine then certainly not.

All processes are computable because, even at the lowest level, these processes are just the evolution of quantum systems which are can be expressed on a quantum computer (and thus, at a greater cost, a classical computer). Any process that occurs in your head, whether it be thinking or just the passive process of existing is something that can be computed. The only thing distinguishing you from a computer that can, PROVEABLY (not in the real world per se, but certainly in principle on a Turing machine), act and function in the same way as you is that you're dressed up in flesh. A fuller computer version of you would also be dressed up in flesh just in a virtual world.

The assumption there was that everything is physical which, again, can be countered with: "what if there is magical dual reality where consciousness resides and it was conveniently inaccessible to us via any testable experiment?" To that I'd respond "yeah, what if".
