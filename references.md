## Interesting Topics
* [Bogobogosort](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/bogobogosort.html) --- A sorting algorithm that will take longer than the [heat death of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe) to complete on any sizable list.
* [Intelligent Design Sort](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/intelligentdesignsort.html) --- Turns out the list was already sorted!
